# ICS3VC-Joseph-Friesen
My name is Joe. I am a high school student studying computer science and learning the fundamentals of programming using Python. So far, I have worked on activities and assignments that focus on problem solving, logic, variables, loops, conditionals, and basic program structure.

I am interested in computer science because I enjoy understanding how things work and creating solutions using code. Programming allows me to be creative while also thinking logically, and I like seeing my ideas turn into working programs.
